# OpenAFS Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 7, July 2010

Welcome to the June issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at
[http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/](http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/)

## General OpenAFS Progress

OpenAFS 1.5.75 was released on July 7. It includes various fixes and
improvements.

There is the start of a test harness in 1.5.75 and the master git
branch. The tests give output in the Test Anything Protocol (TAP), which
makes it easy to integrate tests written different languages. All tests
will eventually reside in the "tests" folder in git. Please refer to the
"tests/README" and "tests/HOWTO" files in the openafs git repository for
more information on how to write tests.

As was discussed in the chat rooms and mailing lists, the
\--enable-fast-restart configure option has been removed on the master
branch to deter novice users from using it without understanding the
ramifications.  This option allows the file server to restart after a
crash without salvaging volumes first.  This option is dangerous because
data corruption may go unnoticed because the volumes might not be salvaged
while a good backup is still around. The demand-attach file server offers
a better option, which allows for quicker start up than the
non-demand-attach server with less chance of data corruption.  Only the
fast-restart configure option was removed.  The fast-restart code will
remain in the tree until at least version 2.0.  If you still need to
enable the fast-restart functionality and understand the consequences,
then run configure, add the line "\#define FAST\_RESTART 1" to
src/config/afsconfig.h and compile.

Around the time of the 1.5.75 release, a new development plan was
announced. The new plan calls for multiple simultaneously developed
branches, which will be released as different versions. The new versions
will be as follows:

- 1.6.x (stable) - branching is imminent. The 1.6 branch will be cut form the
current master branch. Some release candidates will be released to iron
out the bugs before the 1.6.0 release. 1.6 will be the new stable branch,
which will replace 1.4.
- 1.7.x (development) - This branch will be based on the 1.6 branch sometime
after 1.6.0 is released. It will include all patches from 1.6.x and will
serve the integration of the Native Windows (IFS) client.
- 1.8.x (stable) - Once 1.7 is considered stable, the 1.8 branch will be cut
from 1.7 and, the 1.6 branch will be retired.
- 1.9.x (development) - After the 1.6 branch is cut, the master branch will
be opened for various changes targeted for 1.9. This will include IFS and
non-IFS changes. The plan is to focus resources on having a 1.6.0 release
before a 1.9.0 release, but these releases may happen out of order.
- 2.0.x (stable) - based on 1.9. The IFS client is planned to be
included. The 2.0.0 release will not happen before the 1.8.0 release.

The AFSLore Wiki has a new location and different software. The new
location is [http://wiki.openafs.org/AFSLore/WebHome/](http://wiki.openafs.org/AFSLore/WebHome/), and the wiki was
converted from twiki to ikiwiki. ikiwiki allows the wiki content to be
stored in git. This allows for content edits to be done through the web or
through git.

## Case Study - University of Maryland, College Park

In this issue, I would like thank Thomas Payerle from The University of
Maryland (College Park) for being profiled in the newsletter. --Jason

Thomas Payerle is an IT Sys Analyst at UMD.

Jason: How many full-time and part-time people are responsible for AFS
support and in what capacity?

Thomas: A manager and five full-time staff, however, administering AFS is
a fairly small part of their job.  Other responsibilities include support
of the campus Kerberos infrastructure, three medium-sized high performance
computing clusters, and general system support for 300 or so University
Solaris and Linux systems.

Jason: How much data do you store in AFS?

Thomas: We have 40TB or so dedicated to AFS storage.  About 5TB resides on
our SAN and 35TB on direct attached RAID storage.  Actual usage is much
less.

Jason: Do you use contractors or vendors to augment your workforce? If so,
do they use your AFS space?

Thomas: Rarely, but if the need arises and AFS access is required, we
provide it.

Jason: How do you use OpenAFS?

Thomas: OpenAFS is integral to the Unix environment that comprises our
academic, research, and computing infrastructure.  We use it to replicate
core OS components and applications running on Linux and Solaris.  We also
use it to deploy some Microsoft Windows applications.  User home
directories and web pages reside in AFS, as does the University's central
web hosting and WebSphere environments.  Access to AFS has traditionally
been provided via a native client, which is installed by default on all
supported Linux and Solaris machines and by hand on Windows and Macintosh
desktops on an as needed basis.  More recently, we also have begun
providing AFS access via a native web interface (a locally-modified MFILE
clone) and via WebDAV.

Jason: How many servers do you have?

Thomas: 10 file servers, 3 DB servers

Jason: Are they in different locations? How far apart are they?

Thomas: Servers reside in three campus locations that are approximately
0.25 miles (0.5 km) apart.

Jason: Do you use any other network storage to supplement AFS, like Dropbox, or
Windows shares?

Is AFS the only networked file-system that you use?

If not, what are the others, and how do they compare/contrast?

If applicable, why do you use the other file-systems?

Thomas: Microsoft DFS is the networked file-system of choice for Windows
desktops attached to the campus Active Directory infrastructure.  CIFS is
also used, though predominantly to integrate Windows desktops in
departments with Linux infrastructures.  Such departments also often use
NFS, especially those units who have the need/desire for departmental
control.  NFS is also often used to provide access to large data sets for
researchers with high-speed network connections who don't need the
management features of AFS and don't benefit much from its caching
performance.

Finally, Lustre is replacing NFS in the HPCC arena due to its high
performance

Jason: Is your investment in AFS increasing or decreasing?

Thomas: No change.

## AFS Protocol Standardization

Informal drafts that haven't been uploaded to the IETF web site:

Rx Spec:

[http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html](http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html)

This draft is in the very early stages. Mike Meffie and Tom Keiser are the
current owners of this proposal. A formal specification of Rx is needed as
a basis for other IETF proposals.

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
[http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization](http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization)

### PTS Alternate Authentication

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names)

Status: Third Draft

draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names continues to be available for
review. There is still discussion about the technical content and
background references.

### AFS Callback Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo)

Status: Active - Waiting on RPC refresh

The callback draft is stable.  There is a published implementation. My
understanding is that it is accepted with the requirement that it be
adjusted to use RPC refresh data types, which means AFSFetchStatus64 and
the new 100ns time data type.  This is regarded as "trivial" but at the
same time, the spec can't be standardized as is.  It is planned for merge
in, IIRC, 1.9/1.10.

\--Matt Benjamin

### RXGK

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk)

Status: Active

Rxgk is a security layer for AFS which will support strong encryption and
authentication through Kerberos v5, GSI and any other GSSAPI security
mechanism.

Changes which are considered suitable for the 1.5.x series are in git -
look for changes with author sxw@your-file-system.com. A development tree,
which will be frequently rebased, is at
http://github.com/your-file-system/openafs-rxgk

Last Update: Jan 9, 2010

### AFS3 ACL Rights

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions)

Status: Second draft

Last update: January 13, 2010

This draft calls for volume-level restrictions on what users with 'a'
administrator rights to a folder may do. For example, you may want to
prevent users from granting 'w' write access to 'system:anyuser', which
would give anyone in the world with an AFS client write access.

### Rx Security Object Providing Cleartext Peer Identity Assertions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear)

Status: Third draft

Last Update: April 17, 2010

I released a new version of the Rx Clear security class I-D the other
day.  I am hereby soliciting comments on this new version of the
draft.

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear)

The major changes in this version of the document are:

- new introductory section that better explains the relationship
between Rx and AFS-3 so that the document is more approachable for
novices
- additional prose in the security considerations section which better
explains how this security object changes the attack vectors, as well
as a brief mention of securing rxnull/rxclear with IPsec
- flesh out the AFS assigned numbers registrar section with formal
specifications for each newly requested registry
- change the endpoint identifier type enumeration from 32-bits to
8-bits, as the larger size seemed quite wasteful
- mark several security header fields as reserved for future use
- I added a number of informative references to Transarc and CMU ITC
tech reports

### AFSVol Tag-Length-Value Remote Procedure Call Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv)

Status: Third Draft

Last Update: June 15, 2010

Here is the change log for this revision:

- ERRATA: AFSCAPABILITIESMAX is actually defined to be 196, not 192
- add section re: cache coherence to the tag enumeration RPC
- add section re: day-of-week usage following discussion with mmeffie
- s/AFSVOL\_TLV\_TAG\_VOL\_DAY\_USE/AFSVOL\_TLV\_TAG\_VOL\_STAT\_USE\_TODAY/ following
discussion with mmeffie
- add AFSVOL\_TLV\_TAG\_VOL\_STAT\_USE\_TODAY\_DATE following discussion with
mmeffie
- add section re: definition of each tlv payload type
- add section re: definition of each tlv flag
- add note soliciting comments to afs3-stds list
- s/GCO Registrar/AFS Assigned Numbers Registrar/
- s/afsint/AFSVol/ so that we keep our options open with respect to wider
standardization of TLV semantics
- add AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_UINT64\_VEC payload type
- convert various tags from AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_OPAQUE to
AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_UINT64\_VEC
- add AFSVOL\_TLV\_FLAG\_QUALIFIER\_NO\_MATCH flag
- write AFSVol TLV Payloads registry definition
- write AFSVol TLV Tags registry definition
- add registry for AFSVol\_TLV.tlv\_flags
- add registry for AFSVol\_stat\_use\_per\_dow.stat\_flags
- write AFSVol Vol State Expls registry definition
- write AFSVol Program Types registry definition
- add numeric value assignments for newly created registries
- add RFC section references to new allocations
- add reference to Simon's AFS-STDS charter
- add an appendix with sample XDR for AFSVol Capabilities
- add an appendix with sample XDR for AFSVol TLV
- various cosmetic improvements (e.g. adding vspace tags)

Moving forward, I propose making one change in -03.  Namely, I want to
split type AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_UINT64 up into a few types that embed some
limited semantic knowledge into the TLV layer.  Specifically, I'm thinking
of splitting AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_UINT64 into the following six types:

- AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_UINT64    \[generic unit-less type, as before\]
- AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_TIME\_ABS  \[Simon's rpc refresh 100ns unit; absolute\]
- AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_TIME\_REL  \[Simon's rpc refresh 100ns unit; relative\]
- AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_BLOCKS    \[storage in 1KiB units\]
- AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_VOLUME\_ID
- AFSVOL\_TLV\_TYPE\_PARTITION\_ID

All six would be backed by afs\_uint64 in the AFSVol\_TLV\_value union. While
this change isn't strictly necessary, it's relatively straightforward to
implement, and makes the resulting volume TLV data considerably more
self-describing.

As always, comments and feedback are invited.

### AFS Byte-Range File Locking

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mbenjamin-afs-file-locking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mbenjamin-afs-file-locking)

Status: Fifth Draft

This draft proposes protocol extensions to support byte-range and
mandatory locking.

The first draft was submitted on May 5, 2010.

## Projects

### Demand-Attach FileServer (DAFS)

Project Contacts:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>
- Tom Keiser <tkeiser@sinenomine.net>
- Mike Meffie <mmeffie@sinenomine.net>

The DAFS bug mentioned at the workshop involving restoring fileserver
state has been fixed (gerrit 2205). One more DAFS bug involving
demand-salvages of on-line volumes has been identified and is being
worked on (gerrit 2329). A proposed run-time option is in gerrit 2277 to
enable fast-restart-like functionality with DAFS. We're also working on
Admin Guide and Quick Start documentation for DAFS, as well as always
building DAFS and non-DAFS binaries (instead of having DAFS be a
configure-time option). The positional I/O work and threaded salvaging
work is postponed until after 1.6 has been branched.

\--Andrew

### Better Documentation

Project Contacts:

- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
- Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com>

One of the remaining demand-attach binaries has now been documented,
leaving only one left to document.  There have been some other, more minor
improvements to the man page documentation.

The OpenAFS wiki has been relocated from dementia.org to a new permanent
home and temporary URL at openafs-wiki.stanford.edu, probably soon to get
a \*.openafs.org DNS name.  It is now using ikiwiki, and the eventual plan
is to allow people to check out and commit to the underlying Git
repository via Gerrit, which is more efficient than using the web editor
for significant work.



### User-space cache manager

Project Contact:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>

No update (on hold until 1.6 has branched).

\--Andrew

### Kerberos v5 and multiple encryption types

Project Contacts:

- Matt Benjamin <matt@linuxbox.com>
- Marcus Watts <mwd@umich.edu>

The next rxk5 "m" base will be 1.5.74.  Before dealing with the new
"afsconf\_PickClientSecObj", I updated rxk5 "xo" (1.4 base).  \[ The
gatekeepers need not care, but rxk5 for 1.4 is more interesting to
potential testers, then there's rxosd which has unique crypto. \] Nearly
all of my recent work has been on refining patch splitting.  I'm up to
over 100 distinct patches.  The split process can work on m, xo, or in the
future rxk5 for rxosd or 1.6 or 1.9 The next snapshot I do will be of
"xo".  Feedback for those patches will improve what I do next for 1.5.74.

\--Marcus

- update to 1.5.74/75
- improve patch splitout process
- move to git(devel/temp)
- test on windows
- implement anonymous callback protection

\--Marcus Watts

### S3 Front-end for AFS

Project Contacts:

- Fabrizio Manfredi <fabrizio.manfredi@gmail.com>
- Claudio Bisegni <Claudio.Bisegni@lnf.infn.it>

We have a new internal snapshot (alpha2) with 90% of the S3 functions.  We
have also a non-AFS-based simple authentication and some revision
primitives, but it lacks some parts like logging or load balancing.  We
hope to release a preview soon.

\--Manfred

### Virtual Machine Images

Project Contact:

- Fabrizio Manfredi <fabrizio.manfredi@gmail.com>

Update operating system to CentOS 5.5 with two VMware snapshot inside, one
is based on openafs 1.4.12.1 second it is based on openafs 1.5.74.  I also
updated the AFS Perl module to 2.6.2.  Link for download:
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/s3afs/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/s3afs/files/)

We also develop a generic "binding" interface with swig for scripting
languages, you will find in the next update

### Google Summer of Code 2010

Abstract:

The AFS protocol offers encryption for data transport from client to
server. However, that data is stored on the server in cleartext, where it
can potentially be read by the administrators of that server. This poses a
real world problem for organizations who wish to outsource the provision
of their file storage, whilst keeping their data confidential. This
project would augment the existing AFS client to support encrypting data
blocks before sending them to the file server.

I have finished modifications to the LKM so that it now builds. I'm
currently working on learning how to use ddb to debug it as it still
crashes when loaded. The next step will be to move on to debugging
functionality.

The basic versions of the functions have been tested on both Linux and
Windows and the the tests have been verified against the Microsoft
implementation. A draft of the extended functions has also been
written. The current focus is implementing tests for the extended
functionalities of the extended functions to test the draft
implementation and verify the functionality against the Microsoft
implementation.
