# OpenAFS Newsletter, Issue 7, November 2009

Welcome to the seventh issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at
[http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/](http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/)

In reply to Derrick's request for a pony, here it is: "u". Unfortunately,
a Nethack pony is all that we have the budget for. ;)

## General OpenAFS Progress

OpenAFS 1.5.66 was released on October 24. Key highlights include support
for Windows 7 and Server 2008R2.

October's discussion of the AFS lock icon was concluded. The OpenAFS
provider in Network Identity Manager now includes a lock icon which shows
OpenAFS status and token status similar to the old AFScrds program. The
network mount functionality in AFScreds is now shipped disabled by
default.

Simon Wilkinson and Derrick Brashear put out a call for code reviewers. We
need people to review the pending changes in Gerrit. Everyone is welcome
to review some code. It can help those who aren't familiar with the code
to become more familiar with it. To get started in reviewing, go to
[http://gerrit.openafs.org](http://gerrit.openafs.org) and login using your OpenID
credentials. Download the patch and apply it to the latest git tree, then
compile it and test it. Report your results with each patch in Gerrit. If
you need help getting started, ask on the openafs-devel list, the \#openafs
IRC channel or the Jabber chat room.

Mike Meffie proposed a finer set of access controls to prevent users with
admin rights on a folder from giving overly permissive access to other
users or groups. This is part of a effort to find a safer way to deal with
public facing AFS sites. We want to encourage people to chime in with
their ideas and reach a general census so we can move forward and improve
AFS.

## Events

### Annual Best Practices Workshop

Plans are already underway for the seventh Workshop, to be held May 24-28,
2010, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  We hope to see
you there.

### European AFS Conference

The date for the 3rd European AFS & Kerberos Conference has been set. The
conference will take place in Pilsen, Czech Republic, from September 13 to
September 15, 2010. More details are forthcoming and will be posted at
[http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz](http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz).

## Projects

### AFS Protocol Standardization

Two more proposals came out of the Edinburg AFS Hackathon, but haven't
been discussed much on the afs-standardization list:

- http://www.dementia.org/~shadow/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names-00.html
- http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~tkeiser/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear-00.html

Mike Meffie reformatted Nickolai Zeldovich's draft Rx protocol
specification (from 2002) as an Internet Draft and, with his permission, is
sharing it.

The reformatted document is available via http and AFS at:

[http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html](http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html)

/afs/sinenomine.net/user/mmeffie/public/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html 

\[Ed.: I give my thanks to Simon Wilkinson for providing an excellent
summary of the current status of the proposals. Most of this section was
taken from one of Simon's emails.\]

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
[http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization](http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization)

#### AFS Callback Extensions

[http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo-00.txt](http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo-00.txt)

Status: Active

We need to decide whether we're going to wait for the RPC refresh changes
before publishing extended callbacks. My belief is that that's the only
factor currently delaying this document. The question here, essentially,
is whether anyone would deploy extended callbacks before deploying updated
RPCs. To date, nobody has said they would do so.

\--Simon Wilkinson

#### DNS SRV Resource Records for AFS

[http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records-01.txt](http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records-01.txt)

Status: Active

I think this is pretty much done from our perspective. In this draft's
case, I think it's perfectly fair to get it published through the IETF, as
an individual submission, given it updates a protocol element (AFSDB
records) that are already specified in an RFC.

We have two problems that are delaying this, and other initiatives:

The first is that there has been no movement since last year on
establishing a clearer footing for the work done on this
\[afs3-standardization\] list. The draft I published suggests that the g.c.o
registrars bootstrap the process, but so far they haven't had sufficient
time to do so. At some point, if they remain unable to get it off the
ground, we're going to have to come up with another mechanism.

There is also a general issue about how to publish the wider set of AFS
protocol documents - the current proposal is that they go through the
independent submission stream, and eventually appear as RFCs. To date, I
don't think we've approached anyone with regards to this plan, and the
whole RFC publishing processing is going through significant change at
present. We need to resolve this before things like extended callbacks can
move forwards.

\--Simon Wilkinson

I've received no responses since version -01 of the draft, so I was about
to ask about what the next step is.  Should I make a last call for
comments here and then approach the IESG about publication?

### Demand-Attach FileServer (DAFS)

Project Contacts:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>
- Tom Keiser <tkeiser@sinenomine.net>
- Mike Meffie <mmeffie@sinenomine.net>

A fix for 124484 (volserver salvages) is in gerrit 787 and is undergoing
review. We believe this to be the last 'critical' DAFS issue, so we would
encourage that anyone with an interest in using DAFS test DAFS with that
fix. There are still other (mostly performance-related) issues we are
continuing to work on, but we know of no other critical DAFS-specific
problems.

\--Andrew

### Mac OS X OpenAFS Preference Pane

Project Contact:

- Claudio Bisegni <Claudio.Bisegni@lnf.infn.it>

The only update is the automatic link creation on the Desktop for custom
paths. Now, I'm trying to see if I can use FUSE to make these paths
mountable as real volumes.

\--Claudio

### Better Documentation

Project Contacts:

- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
- Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com>

Several man page updates have gone into the tree since last month, but I
don't think there's been any significant progress on the larger documents.

One useful documentation project that we could ask for volunteers to work
on is writing man pages for the new binaries that were added as part of
the demand-attach file server work.

\--Russ

### Kerberos v5 and multiple encryption types

Project Contacts:

- Matt Benjamin <matt@linuxbox.com>
- Marcus Watts <mwd@umich.edu>

Simon and I discussed some of the issues yesterday via XMPP.  We agree
there are lots of things Marcus and I can do, but a lot of things become
easier and more useful to do when upstream is ready start thinking about
rxk5 in detail.  Simon pointed out that once 1.6 branches, rxk5 patches
can flow onto head--and that means that folks can start reviewing changes
for potential merge.  Even if it takes a while to get through them, that's
the most efficient process to be on, and the sooner we can start it, the
more productive we can be.

\--Matt

### S3 Front-end for AFS

Project Contacts:

- Fabrizio Manfredi <fabrizio.manfredi@gmail.com>
- Claudio Bisegni <Claudio.Bisegni@lnf.infn.it>

Small description of S3AFS:

First of all, Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can
be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from
anywhere on the web.

S3AFS is a web application, it provides a local implementation of the S3
service. This can be useful if you want to make use of the Amazon S3 web
service interface but host the storage on your own OpenAFS cell. The first
step of the project is mapping the OpenAFS resources to a S3 client, then
you can read your file and directory as a key of a S3 bucket. The second
step is to use OpenAFS as an S3 backend.

We have a basic implementation, without authentication and authz, we now
start to understand how to put Authentication (SetAG) in the java multi
thread env.

Progress:

We have a proof of concept, which was presented at the Workshop in Rome,
and we have finished the design and started coding in Java for the
production release. We hope to release a preview in December without ACL
handling. We have to fix some compilation problems in the Java lib in the
1.5.x, which has not been submitted yet.

\--Fabrizio

### Active Directory Backend for Ptserver

Project Contacts:

- Fabrizio Manfredi <fabrizio.manfredi@gmail.com>
- Claudio Bisegni <Claudio.Bisegni@lnf.infn.it>

Ptserver-Ng is a custom implementation of the ptserver with an Active
Directory backend instead of Ubik db. Today, more institutions ask to me a
more generic interface in special way for ldap connection. The new project
is focused on a plugin architecture for a multi-backend
implementation. The first step is to create a more generic database API
(ptdb) and move all the ubik code into this new infrastructure.  Second
step is to create a proxy read/write backend and more generic AD (read
only) backend.

Status : interface definition (ptdb api)

We have finished the interface definition, we start to move
the existing ubik code, no release date are available.

### Virtual Machine Images

Project Contact:

- Fabrizio Manfredi <fabrizio.manfredi@gmail.com>

I have created a set of virtual machines. In this way, everyone can try and
test OpenAFS without installing it.

You can find the VM at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/s3afs/files/

\--Fabrizio

### Pthreaded Ubik

Project Contact:

- Steven Jenkins <steven.jenkins@gmail.com>

Steven has changed employers and email addresses.

There are no updates to the Pthreaded Ubik project. It will not appear in
future newsletters unless there is an update.

### Userspace cache manager

Project Contact:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>

I'm in the middle of adding support for ACL and mountpoint manipulation
(and in general, making pioctl emulation work). Once that is working to
a certain degree, I should be able to work on getting this suitable for
merging in mainline. If anyone wants to use this before then, just ask.

I'd also like to note that apparently it may be possible to emulate PAGs
in linux userspace. So, a fully-featured FUSE client is not as
impossible as I once thought, and may someday exist.

\--Andrew

### Projects with no progress or no update

- Disconnected AFS support
- Rx OSD integration & Raw Vicep Access in Clients
- Extended Callback Information
- \*BSD Support
- OpenAFS Server Preference Based on Network Conditions
