# OpenAFS Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 10, October 2010

Welcome to the October issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at
[http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/](http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/)

There is no case study this month.  Please email Jason if you would like
to volunteer.

## General OpenAFS Progress

The official results for the chairs of the afs3-standardization group is still
pending, waiting on the results from one of the three vote-takers.

Jeffrey Altman announced that the OpenAFS code base needs to migrate away
from MIT Kerberos and towards Heimdal as the primary Kerberos library
<[http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-September/017932.html](http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-September/017932.html)\>.
This change is required to maintain a high-level of Windows support and to
enable the use of stronger encryption. To make this change easier, a shim
library is being developed at
[http://github.com/secure-endpoints/heimdal-krbcompat](http://github.com/secure-endpoints/heimdal-krbcompat), which allows for
either Kerberos distribution to be used. The transition was discussed on
the openafs-devel mailing list with most people preferring that minimal
Heimdal code be imported into the OpenAFS git repository.

## Events

### European AFS Conference

Thanks to Michal Svamberg for providing a summary of the European AFS
Conference. --Ed.

The European OpenAFS & Kerberos Conference 2010
<[http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz](http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz)\> was held between 13 and 15 September 2010
in Pilsen <["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plzeň"](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plzeň)\>, Czech Republic
<["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech\_Republic"](#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech\_Republic)\>. It was hosted by the
Centre for Information Technology, University of West Bohemia
<[http://www.zcu.cz/en/](http://www.zcu.cz/en/)\>.  Earlier international conferences took place
in Graz (2008) <[http://www.openafs.at/](http://www.openafs.at/)\> and Rome (2009)
<["http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~afscon09/"](#http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~afscon09/)\>.

The number of participants grows steadily and the event promises to become
a regular European forum for OpenAFS users and developers. This year,
there were 75 participants from nine different countries. In addition,
on-line audience counting more than 50 viewers around the world was
watching live streams.

The organizing institute has been an AFS user for many years, having
started the early experiments with Transarc AFS in 1994 and relying on AFS
as the only distributed file system across the campus (23000+ accounts,
200+ servers, 7800+ end user PCs) since 1996. Find more information on the
distributed environment deployed by the hosting institute as well as other
organizations relying on AFS and Kerberos in posters
<["http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=sr"](#http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=sr)\>.

To name but a few lectures from the program:

- Christof Hanke: Cell management and monitoring
<["http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=hanke\_tools"](#http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=hanke\_tools)\> - The talk
presented monitoring infrastructure based on nagios, used at the RZG in
developing a new management structure for its large cell.
- Love Hörnquist Astrand: Heimdal - new features in 1.5
<["http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=heimdal"](#http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=heimdal)\> - The talk
discussed features added with the upcoming 1.5 release and additional
changes to related Heimdal projects.
- Thomas Keiser: Deploying the Demand Attach File Server
<["http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=dafs"](#http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=dafs)\> - This talk gave a
brief overview of administrator-visible changes in the DAFS file server,
and then cover issues involved in migrating a production deployment to the
forthcoming OpenAFS 1.6 DAFS file server.

Visit the conference web site at [http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/agenda.php](http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/agenda.php)
to watch recordings of other interesting talks.

The conference program also included two tutorials. The first one,
Advanced Tuning & Troubleshooting
<["http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=tutorial-II"](#http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=tutorial-II)\>, was given by
Derrick Brashear and Jeffrey Altman. Participants were invited to present
problems they are facing and received tips for tuning their environment to
achieve better performance.

The second tutorial, Setting-up your AFS Cell
<["http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=tutorial-I"](#http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/desc.php?name=tutorial-I)\>, was given by
Wolfgang Alexander Gehrke and Christof Hanke. It focused on beginners, who
learned about the internals of the system and had a chance to try and set
up their own file servers within a testing infrastructure.

The official program was complemented by social events. Participants have
learned about the World's best beer, seen the brewery and tasted the final
product. The organizers were delighted by their enthusiasm and also by the
persistence of those who endured until late night or even early morning.
See the image gallery <[http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/gallery.php](http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/gallery.php)\> for
photographs taken at the conference sessions as well as the social events.

We would like to thank all attendants and we are looking forward to next
year's event, which is going to be hosted by DESY <[http://www.desy.de/](http://www.desy.de/)\>
in Hamburg.

## AFS Protocol Standardization

Informal drafts that haven't been uploaded to the IETF web site:

Rx Spec:

[http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html](http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html)

This draft is in the very early stages. Mike Meffie and Tom Keiser are the
current owners of this proposal. A formal specification of Rx is needed as
a basis for other IETF proposals.

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
[http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization](http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization)

### PTS Alternate Authentication

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names)

Status: Seventh Draft

Last update: August 31, 2010

A request for last call will happen soon.

\--Derrick

### AFS Callback Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo)

Status: Active - Waiting on RPC refresh

Last Update: September 23, 2009

The callback draft is stable.  There is a published implementation. My
understanding is that it is accepted with the requirement that it be
adjusted to use RPC refresh data types, which means AFSFetchStatus64 and
the new 100ns time data type.  This is regarded as "trivial" but at the
same time, the spec can't be standardized as is.  It is planned for merge
in, IIRC, 1.9/1.10.

\--Matt Benjamin

### RXGK

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk)

Status: Active

Last Draft Update: Jan 9, 2010

A working implementation of rxgk was demonstrated at the European AFS &
Kerberos Workshop in Pilsen. Whilst there is still work to be done, both
on completing the implementation, and on getting the code into the OpenAFS
tree, this is an important milestone. Slides from the Pilsen talk are
available on their web site, the current rxgk code is, as always,
available on github.

\--Simon Wilkinson

### AFS3 ACL Rights

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions)

Status: Second draft

Last update: January 13, 2010

We're waiting for the afs3-standardization structure to solidify before
proceeding with this. So, no progress right now.

\--Andrew Deason

### Rx Security Object Providing Clear-text Peer Identity Assertions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear)

Status: Third draft

Last Update: April 17, 2010

I released a new version of the Rx Clear security class I-D the other
day.  I am hereby soliciting comments on this new version of the
draft.

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear)

The major changes in this version of the document are:

- new introductory section that better explains the relationship
between Rx and AFS-3 so that the document is more approachable for
novices
- additional prose in the security considerations section which better
explains how this security object changes the attack vectors, as well
as a brief mention of securing rxnull/rxclear with IPsec
- flesh out the AFS assigned numbers registrar section with formal
specifications for each newly requested registry
- change the endpoint identifier type enumeration from 32-bits to
8-bits, as the larger size seemed quite wasteful
- mark several security header fields as reserved for future use
- I added a number of informative references to Transarc and CMU ITC
tech reports

\--Tom

### AFSVol Tag-Length-Value Remote Procedure Call Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv)

Status: Fourth Draft

Last Update: August 4, 2010

The other week I submitted a new draft to the IETF which implements
the aforementioned changes (as well as a few others).  The new draft
is available at the following URLs:

- [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-03](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-03)

- [http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~tkeiser/i-d/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-02-03.xml.diff](http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~tkeiser/i-d/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-02-03.xml.diff)

- [file:///afs/sinenomine.net/user/tkeiser/public\_html/i-d/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-03.html](file:///afs/sinenomine.net/user/tkeiser/public\_html/i-d/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-03.html)
- [file:///afs/sinenomine.net/user/tkeiser/public\_html/i-d/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-03.xml](file:///afs/sinenomine.net/user/tkeiser/public\_html/i-d/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-03.xml)
- [file:///afs/sinenomine.net/user/tkeiser/public\_html/i-d/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-02-03.xml.diff](file:///afs/sinenomine.net/user/tkeiser/public\_html/i-d/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv-02-03.xml.diff)

The complete revision history is as follows:

- split unsigned 64-bit type down into several more descriptive types
that allow the TLV data stream to be more self-describing.
- add a signed 64-bit integer type to allow for relative timestamps
- now that we have more descriptive types, use them in a number of places
- change AFSVOL\_TLV\_TAG\_VOL\_TRANS\_CALL\_VALID into a boolean type payload
- make sure rxgen can parse the XDR in the appendix
- make sure generated C code compiles and links
- add in-text cites for AFS3-VVL, AFS3-FSCM, DAFS, and OSD.
- provide motivations for GetCapabilities RPC
- provide protocol semantic definitions for each newly allocated capability bit
- allocate AFSVOL\_TLV\_FLAG\_MORE bit to notify caller when we can't
send all tags due to AFSVOL\_TLV\_TAG\_MAX length limit

Any comments or feedback are appreciated.

\--Tom

### AFS Byte-Range File Locking

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mbenjamin-afs-file-locking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mbenjamin-afs-file-locking)

Status: Fifth Draft

This draft proposes protocol extensions to support byte-range and
mandatory locking.

The first draft was submitted on May 5, 2010.

## Projects

### Demand-Attach FileServer (DAFS)

Project Contacts:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>
- Tom Keiser <tkeiser@sinenomine.net>
- Mike Meffie <mmeffie@sinenomine.net>

A fix for improving startup preattachment speed was merged (gerrit
2648), as well as the minor fixes for -vhashsize (2649, 2650). The fix
for salvaging attached volumes (2329) was almost merged, but had a
conflict that was recently resolved and hasn't been merged yet. More
prerequisites for salvageserver threading improvements have been merged
(1862, 1863), and the improvements themselves should be in soon, as
well. A fix for log-related performance problems with large numbers of
volumes was submitted and merged in gerrit 2759.

\--Andrew

### Better Documentation

Project Contacts:

- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
- Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com>

There were a few minor fixes, but I don't think any significant changes in
the past month.

\--Russ

Due to classwork, the only progress I've been able to make so far is to
merge the changes from the summer with master.

The version that I pushed up still only had a mountable LKM, was able to
retrieve the names of the files from the server but could not actually
create the vnodes. So what remains is to finish debugging vnode creation,
then move on to reading/writing, permissions, etc.

Unfortunately, I cloned master today and was unable to compile it again
due to some Heimdal changes that had been merged. Those aren't from me,
however.  :)
